We would have to make sure every line is changed, which leaves a lot of room for error. Since we're using that star over and over again, wouldn't it be nice if we could define a \"nickname\" for that code, and then use the nickname over and over in place of the expression? === Investigate You already know how to do this in math: @math{x = 4 + 2} evaluates the expression, and _defines_ the nickname @math{x} to be the value 6. @ifproglang{wescheme}{ WeScheme uses the word \"define\" to make this even clearer!

[.lesson-point] Expressions evaluate to answers. Definitions don't. Think back to math: @math{x = 4 + 2} doesn't have an \"answer\".

Have them identify what structure is repeated . Have them use a value definition to simplify the code . Have them change the stars from black back to yellow *Optional* (for a longer time commitment): Have students choose a flag from this list of images: @link{pages/flags-of-the-world-resource.pdf, (Flags of the World)}, and recreate one (or more!) of the flags using `define` and any of the other functions they've learned so far. === Synthesize How many reasons can students come up with for why defining values is useful?"

There are lots of potential problems with duplicate code: - *Readability:* The more code there is, the harder it can be to read. - *Performance:* Why re-evaluate the same code a dozen times, when we can evaluate it _once_ and use the result as many times as we need? - *Maintainability:* Suppose we needed to change the size of the stars in the examples above. We would have to make sure every line is changed, which leaves a lot of room for error. Since we're using that star over and over again, wouldn't it be nice if we could define a \"nickname\" for that code, and then use the nickname over and over in place of the expression? === Investigate You already know how to do this in math: @math{x = 4 + 2} evaluates the expression, and _defines_ the nickname @math{x} to be the value 6. @ifproglang{wescheme}{ WeScheme uses the word \"define\" to make this even clearer!

[.lesson-point] Expressions evaluate to answers. Definitions don't. Think back to math: @math{x = 4 + 2} doesn't have an \"answer\".

Since we're using that star over and over again, wouldn't it be nice if we could define a \"nickname\" for that code, and then use the nickname over and over in place of the expression? === Investigate You already know how to do this in math: @math{x = 4 + 2} evaluates the expression, and _defines_ the nickname @math{x} to be the value 6. @ifproglang{wescheme}{ WeScheme uses the word \"define\" to make this even clearer! We can type `(define x (+ 4 2))` to define `x` to be the value 6. } @ifproglang{pyret}{ Pyret is no different! We type `x = 4 + 2` to define `x` to be the value 6. } [.lesson-instruction] - Start a new program, and type this code into the Interactions Area. - What happens when you hit Enter? - Can you explain what happened or didn't happen? [.lesson-point] Expressions evaluate to answers. Definitions don't. Think back to math: @math{x = 4 + 2} doesn't have an \"answer\". All it does is tell us that anytime we see @math{x}, we know it stands for 6. We only see a result when we _use_ that definition, for example @math{x \\times 5} will evaluate to 30. [.lesson-instruction] On the computer, try using the definition of `x` by multiplying it by 5. - *What is the usefulness of defining values?* _Lets the programmer reuse code, saves time, lets the programmer make changes easily, allows us to more easily use elements inside other functions_ - *What datatypes can we define values for?* _All of them - Number, String, Image_ [.strategy-box, cols=\"1\", grid=\"none\", stripes=\"none\"] |=== | @span{.title}{Support for English Language Learners} MLR 8 - Discussion Supports: As students discuss, rephrase responses as questions and encourage precision in the words being used to reinforce the meanings behind some of the programming-specific language, such as \"define\" and \"value\". |=== Of course, the whole point of defining a value is so that it sticks around and can be used later! That's why programmers put their definitions on the _left-hand side_, known as the @vocab{Definitions Area}. [.lesson-instruction] - Complete @workbook-link{pages/defining-values-explore.adoc} in your student workbook. What else can you define? - Complete @workbook-link{pages/defining-values-practice.adoc} with their partner. == Cleaning Up Code @duration{20 minutes} === Overview This activity is a chance to _play_ with new concepts, combining value definitions and function composition to create new shapes or to clean up code that generates shapes. The engaging nature of the activity is designed to motivate lots of experiments, each of which gives students a chance to practice applying those concepts. === Launch The ability to define values allows us to look for - and make use of - structure in our code or in our equations. What structure is repeated in this expression? @span{.center}{@math{(x + 1)^2 - \\frac{4}{(x + 1)} * -2(x + 1)}} === Investigate Have students open @ifproglang{wescheme}{@link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=c5SB38KcVD, this file} @ifproglang{pyret}{@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1qUY9u9j_NfZM8PJwT9QKJKNlD3RPbSDE, this file} , which draws the Chinese flag. . This file uses a function students haven't seen before! What is it? . What is it its contract? . Have them change the color of all the stars from yellow to black . Have them identify what structure is repeated . Have them use a value definition to simplify the code . Have them change the stars from black back to yellow *Optional* (for a longer time commitment): Have students choose a flag from this list of images: @link{pages/flags-of-the-world-resource.pdf, (Flags of the World)}, and recreate one (or more!) of the flags using `define` and any of the other functions they've learned so far. === Synthesize How many reasons can students come up with for why defining values is useful?"
