6-8.Algorithms and Programming.Variables:: Programmers create variables to store data values of selected types. A meaningful identifier is assigned to each variable to access and perform operations on the value by name. Variables enable the flexibility to represent different situations, process different sets of data, and produce varying outputs.
{startsb}See:  link:./lessons/pass:[ds-defining-functions]/index.shtml[Defining Functions].{endsb}
6-8.Computing Systems.Troubleshooting:: Comprehensive troubleshooting requires knowledge of how computing devices and components work and interact. A systematic process will identify the source of a problem, whether within a device or in a larger system of connected devices.
{startsb}See:  link:./lessons/pass:[ds-checking-your-work]/index.shtml[Checking Your Work].{endsb}
6-8.Data and Analysis.Collection:: People design algorithms and tools to automate the collection of data by computers. When data collection is automated, data is sampled and converted into a form that a computer can process. For example, data from an analog sensor must be converted into a digital form. The method used to automate data collection is influenced by the availability of tools and the intended use of the data.

9-12.Computing Systems.Troubleshooting:: Troubleshooting complex problems involves the use of multiple sources when researching, evaluating, and implementing potential solutions. Troubleshooting also relies on experience, such as when people recognize that a problem is similar to one they have seen before or adapt solutions that have worked in the past.
{startsb}See:  link:./lessons/pass:[ds-checking-your-work]/index.shtml[Checking Your Work].{endsb}
9-12.Data and Analysis.Collection:: Data is constantly collected or generated through automated processes that are not always evident, raising privacy concerns. The different collection methods and tools that are used influence the amount and quality of the data that is observed and recorded.
{startsb}See:  link:./lessons/pass:[ds-ethics-and-privacy]/index.shtml[Ethics and Privacy].{endsb}
9-12.Data and Analysis.Inference and Models:: The accuracy of predictions or inferences depends upon the limitations of the computer model and the data the model is built upon. The amount, quality, and diversity of data and the features chosen can affect the quality of a model and ability to understand a system. Predictions or inferences are tested to validate models.

9-12.Impacts of Computing.Safety, Law, and Ethics:: Laws govern many aspects of computing, such as privacy, data, property, information, and identity. These laws can have beneficial and harmful effects, such as expediting or delaying advancements in computing and protecting or infringing upon people’s rights. International differences in laws and ethics have implications for computing.
