Students watched 5 videos, and rated them on a scale of 1 to 10. While the  *average score* for every video is the same (5.5), the *shapes* of the ratings distributions were very different!  _Match_ the summary description (left) with the _shape_ of the histogram of student ratings (right). For each histogram, *the x-axis is the score, and the y-axis is the number of students who gave it that score*. These axes are intentionally unlabeled - focusing on the _shape_ is what matters here!

| Most of the students were fine
with the video, but a couple of
them gave it an unusually low
rating.

video an average rating, and
they weren't likely to stray far
from the average.

over the place: high ratings
and low ratings and inbetween ratings were all
equally likely.
