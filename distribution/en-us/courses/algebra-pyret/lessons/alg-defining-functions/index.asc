= Defining Functions

%CURRICULUMspan% class="other-proglang"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%link:{pathwayrootdir}../algebra-wescheme/lessons/alg-defining-functions/index.shtml[(Also available for WeScheme)]%ENDCURRICULUMspan%


Students discover functions as an abstraction over a programming pattern, and are introduced to a structured approach to building them called the Design Recipe.

[.lesson-section-1]
== Warmup

Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into
    link:pass:[https://code.pyret.org][code.pyret.org, window="_blank"] 
on their computer.

[.lesson-section-1]
== Identifying Repeated _Patterns_ %CURRICULUMspan% class="duration"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%30 minutes%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Overview
As with the Defining Values lesson, students search for structure in a list of expressions. But this time, the structures are _dynamic_, meaning they change in a predictable way. This is the foundation for defining functions.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Launch

%CURRICULUMspan% class="tooltip centered-image"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="tooltiptext"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%I Love Green Triangles%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

Confess to your students, "I LOVE green triangles." Challenge them to use the %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Definitions area%ENDCURRICULUMspan% to make as many DIFFERENT solid green triangles as they can in 2 minutes. 

Walk around the room and give positive feedback on the green triangles.  After the 2 minutes, ask for some examples of green triangles that they wrote and copy them to the board.  Be specific and attend to precision with the %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%syntax%ENDCURRICULUMspan% such that students can visually spot the pattern between the different lines of code.

For example:


```
triangle(30,  "solid", "green")
triangle(12,  "solid", "green")
triangle(500, "solid", "green")
```

%CURRICULUMspan% class="title"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Notice and Wonder%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

Direct students to the various lines of code they came up with.
What do you notice?  What do you wonder?
|===

- *Is there a pattern?*
_Yes, the code mostly stayed the same with one change each time._

- *What stayed the same?*
_The function name `triangle`, "solid", "green"._

- *What changed?*
_The number being given to `triangle`, or the %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Number%ENDCURRICULUMspan% input._

- *What strategy did you use to create many different triangles?*
_Answers vary: Pattern matching, copy and paste_

- *What shortcut did we use before when we wanted to use the same code over and over?* +
_We defined values in the Definitions area._

We've learned how to define *values* when we want to create a shortcut to reuse the same code over and over.

For example:

 myStar = star(50, "solid", "gold") 

*But to make a shortcut that _changes_ such as creating solid, green triangles of a changing size, we need to define a _function_.*

Suppose we want to define a shortcut called `gt`. When we give it a number, it makes a solid green triangle of whatever size we gave it. 

Select a student to _act out_ `gt`. Make it clear to the class that their Name is "gt", they expect a Number, and they will produce an Image. Run through some sample examples before having the class add their own:



- You say: *gt 20!*
The student responds: _triangle(20, "solid", "green")!_
- You say: *gt 200!*
The student responds: _triangle(200, "solid", "green")!_
- You say: *gt 99!*
The student responds: _triangle(99, "solid", "green")!_ 


We need to program the computer to be as smart as our volunteer. But how do we do that?

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Investigate

[.lesson-point]
Word Problem: Write a function called `gt` that takes in a Number and produces a solid, green triangle of that given size.

Have students follow along on the link:{pathwayrootdir}pass:[lessons/alg-defining-functions/pages/FastFunctions.html][Fast Functions (Page 26), window="_blank"] handout.

- *1. Write the %CURRICULUMspan% class="vocab"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%contract%ENDCURRICULUMspan% for this new function by looking at the word problem.* +
** What does `gt` take in? +
_A Number_
** What does `gt` give back? +
_An Image. Students may say "a triangle", follow up by asking what data type that triangle will be (Number, String, or Image)_

- *2. Write some examples of how this function should work.*
** If I typed
 `gt(40)` 
, what would I want the program to do? +
_I'd want the computer the execute the code_
    `triangle(40, "solid", "green")`. 

_This is a tough question at first.  If students are unsure, remind them that we're just writing a shortcut for making green triangles so we don't have to type `triangle`, "solid", and "green" every time!_ 

- OPTIONAL: Have students complete the link:{pathwayrootdir}pass:[lessons/alg-defining-functions/pages/MappingExamplesWithCoE.html][Mapping Examples with Circles of Evaluation (Page 25), window="_blank"] worksheet showing how their function examples are working.

- *3. Circle and Label what is "change-able" - or _variable_ between the examples. Circle and label it with a name that describes it.* +
_The number is changing in each example.  We could name it "x", but "size" is a more accurate name._ +



%CURRICULUMspan% class="tooltip centered-image"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%%CURRICULUMspan% class="tooltiptext"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Circle and label what is changing%ENDCURRICULUMspan%
image:{pathwayrootdir}lessons/alg-defining-functions/images/WhatChanges-Pyret.png["Circle and label what is changing", 400, align="center"]link:images/WhatChanges-Pyret.png[%CURRICULUMspan% class="big"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%&#x1f5bc;%ENDCURRICULUMspan%Show image,role="gdrive-only"]%ENDCURRICULUMspan%


- *4. Write the function definition.* +

__Look at the two examples.  The function definition will follow the same pattern, but it will use the variable name `size` in place of the variable part we circled. We also use the keyword `fun`, replace the colon (`is`) with a colon (`:`), and finish it off with an `end`.__ 


 fun gt(size): triangle(size, "solid", "green") end


[.strategy-box, cols="1", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|%CURRICULUMspan% class="title"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%Connecting to Best Practices%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

- Writing the examples is like "showing your work" in math class.

- Have students circle what is changing and label it with a proper variable name.  The name of the variable should reflect what it represents, such as `size`.

- Writing examples and identifying the variables lays the groundwork for writing the function, which is especially important as the functions get more complex.  Don't skip this step!

|===

[.lesson-instruction]
Now that students have defined `gt` have them save their program as 'Defining Functions' and test out their newly created function in the Interactions window.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Synthesize
- *What is the domain for `gt`?*
_Number_

- *Why might someone think the domain for `gt` contains a Number and two Strings, because that's the Domain of `triangle`?*  The function `gt` _uses_ `triangle`, but only needs one Number input because _that's the only part that's changing._
- *Why is defining functions useful to us as programmers?*

[.lesson-section-1]
== Practicing the Design Recipe %CURRICULUMspan% class="duration"%BEGINCURRICULUMspan%flexible%ENDCURRICULUMspan%

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Overview
This is a chance for students to independently review the steps learned in the prior activity, with the teacher in a supporting role asking guiding questions and giving support when needed.  

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Launch
*Word Problem: Write a function called `gold-star` that takes in number and produces a solid, gold star of that given size.*

* Write 2 examples and the definition of `gold-star` on the 'Fast Functions' handout.
* Complete the `gold-star` example on the link:{pathwayrootdir}pass:[lessons/alg-defining-functions/pages/FastFunctions.html][Fast Functions (Page 26), window="_blank"] worksheet.

[.lesson-section-2]
=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- Design a problem for a function that takes in one input and returns a shape that uses that input. Your function's input could be a Number, as in the two examples, or a String.
- Write two examples and a definition for your function
- Complete the link:{pathwayrootdir}pass:[lessons/alg-defining-functions/pages/MappingExamplesWithCoE.html][Mapping Examples with Circles of Evaluation (Page 25), window="_blank"] for the examples of your function.

[.lesson-section-1]
== Closing
The Design Recipe is a powerful tool for solving word problems. In this lesson, students practiced using it on simple _programming problems_, but soon they'll be applying it to traditional math problems. Encourage them to make this connection on their own: can they think of a math problem in which this would be useful?
