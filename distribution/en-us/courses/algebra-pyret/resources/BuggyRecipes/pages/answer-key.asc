= Design Recipe Exercise Answer Key


.target-leap

1. The first example doesn't work. It would work better as
+

`target-leap(100) is 100 * 2` or
`target-leap(100) is 2 * 100`


2. The second example is incorrect according to the problem
   statement. It could be
+

`target-leap(40) is 40 * 2` or
`target-leap(40) is 2 * 40`


3. In the definition, the name of the function should be
`target-leap`.

4. The variable name in the definition should be consistent
(either `x` or `x-coor`).

5. The body of the function definition should be

`x-coor * 2`.



.is-offscreen


1. The Purpose Statement should include “return true if the coordinate is less
than -50 or greater than 690”.

2. Both examples should show the work, not just the answer:
+

a. `is-offscreen(60) is (60 < -50) or (60 > 690)`

+

b. `is-offscreen(800) is (800 < -50) or (800 > 690)`


3. In the definition, the function name should be
 `is-offscreen` instead of `is-off-screen`. 

4. The function definition should use the function `or` instead
   of `and`.

.calc-pencils

1. Both examples should multiply by 5.

2. The variable should be more descriptive: s, or students, to represent the
number of students.

3. In the definition, the function name should be `calc-pencils`.

.circle-area

1. `pi` is not a built-in value, so it should be replaced with an
approximation such as `3.14` or
 `(22 / 7)`. 



2. If using
`(22 / 7)`
for `pi`, the function body could be
+
`num-sqr(diameter / 2) * (22 / 7))`


.check-total

1. The examples should use the function name `check-total` instead
of `total`.




2. Both examples have an extra input that isn't attached to an
   operator or function:
+
`((0.2 * 20) + 20)`

3. The `*` operator must be used instead of `x` to show multiplication in the examples:
+
`((0.20 * 56.67) + 56.67)`

4. The function body should have the `*` and `+` operators
reversed:
+
`(0.20 * food-total) + food-total`



.have-enough-carpet



1. The range of the function should be a Boolean.

2. The example inputs should not be in an extra set of
   parentheses.

3. Both the examples and the function definition should use `<=`
instead of `<`.


4. The example inputs should be separated by a comma.



.have-enough-cash


1. The domain of the function should be a Number (representing
the price), not a String.

2. The two examples should give numbers as an input and test if
they are less than 1.50. For instance,
+

`have-enough-cash(2.50) is 2.50 <= 1.50`


3. The variable name in the function body can be `item`, but a
more accurate name would be `price` or `cost`.


.equal-length


1. The function body should be:
+

`string-length(string1) == string-length(string2)`

2. The inputs in the examples should be in quotes -- `"yes"`,
   `"no"`.


.flower-name

1. The purpose statement should read “Takes in the color and
   returns the name of that flower”.

2. The second example should be
+

`flower-name("purple") is "tulip"`

3. In the examples, all the colors and flower names should be Strings, written inside quotation marks.



.is-long-name


1. Both examples should use the function `string-length`, not
 `string-equal`. 

2. The examples should check if the name is longer than 20
   characters, not 10.



3. The function name in the definition should be `is-long-name`.



4. The body of the function should be
+

`string-length(name) < 20`


.scale-image

1. The purpose statement doesn't specify which strings matter, or
how much to scale by.
+
The examples do not use the `scale` function at all, and instead
change the parameters of the image. The first example should be:
+

----
scale-image(circle(5, "solid", "red"), "bigger") is
         scale(2, circle(5, "solid", "red"))
----


2. The function name in the second example is incorrect.

.state-tax

1. The domain for the function should be
 `String, Number` 
to account for both
the state and the price of the item.

2. The function name in both examples should be `state-tax`.

3. The example inputs (`"Delaware"` and `"Georgia"`) should be
   Strings.

4. Examples should include a numerical price instead of the variable name
`price`.

5. The examples should use `*` not `+`.

6. The function variable name should not contain spaces and must
   be consistent throughout the function definition. It should
   instead be `price`.


.late-to-class


1. Both examples should include 4 numbers as inputs.

2. In the first example, `<` should be used in place of `>`.



3. Both examples and the function definition should calculate
   distance based on the 4 inputs, such as:
+
`late-to-class(40, 55, 80, 100) is 25 < distance(40, 55, 80, 100)`


4. The two examples should be different from each other.  Since
   the function returns a Boolean, good practice would be to make
   one example that is true and another that is false.
